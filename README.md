Project 4 - Machine Learning 
# Purpose:
The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated machine learning solution that you can curate personalized itineraries for your trips. By harnessing the power of advanced algorithms and data analysis, our system will assist you in planning and optimizing your travel experiences.

Through a seamless integration of artificial intelligence and travel data, we will pick out the city that best suits you based on your choices of activities. After your city is chosen we will provide you with an enormous amount of activities to do. 

By utilizing cutting-edge technologies and comprehensive data sources, our aim is to provide you with a highly planned and optimized travel plan. The system will consider a wide range of activities to choose from examples.(skiing, bike riding, bars, night life, beaches, etc.).

With our machine learning-powered category generator, you can unlock the potential of a personalized travel experience. Say goodbye to the headaches and struggles of planning and let our intelligent system take the lead, ensuring that every moment of your trip is optimized, memorable, and tailored to your unique preferences. You will never run out of ideas to do in the city.
